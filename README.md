# GameRoom
This is the final project for CSSE432 - Computer Network course. Basically the application serves as a game room, where users can build connections with other players, choose game to play, and view information like match history and scores. 

# Server
To start the server, simply run `python server.py <portnumber>` wait for the client to connect. The server needs to run before client.

# Client
To run the client, run `python client.py <hostname> <portnumber>` to connect an open server.
